# Rule Engine with AST By Sarang Padulkar

This is a web application that allows users to create and manage rules using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The rules are evaluated against user attributes like age, department, income, etc., to determine eligibility. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, and Mongoose. The frontend uses React.js, Vite, tailwind CSS.


### 1. Setting Up the Backend (Node.js + Express)

1. *Navigate to the backend folder*:

    cd backend
    

2. *Install the required dependencies*:

    npm install
    
   

3. *Start the backend server*:

    npm run dev
    
   The server will start on http://localhost:3001.

### 2. Setting Up the Frontend (ReactJS)

    cd ../frontend
    

2. *Install the required dependencies*:
